# SurfaceEntropy

The software presented here is a SHape-based Accurate Predictor of Entropy (SHAPE). The calculation takes place in two steps (1) Calculation of the molecular surface and the curvature properties (shape index and curvedness) at each vertex in the triangulation (2) Computation of entropy by binning the curvatures.
